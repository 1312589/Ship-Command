# Ship-Command

My 2nd attempt at making a game in GameMaker!

## Idea
A spaceship simulator with multiple people playing together on the same keyboard and screen.  Each player has a different role/class and all of them must work together to achive an aim/ win a battle.

## General Ideas
Role ideas:
* Commander
  * Has an overview of the entire ship and the enemy ship
  * Controls the states (moverment/attack/etc.) of the ship
* Gunner
  * Has higher accuracy and cool-down speeds on the ships guns
* Engineer
  * Allows the engines to run for longer when traveling
  * Can repair damaged systems more efficiently
* Navigator
  * 
  *
* Communications officer
  *
  *
* Shield operator
  * Has higher cool-down speed on shields
  * Shields have longer lives when operated
* Medic
  * Can heal other members of the crew
  * Can move faster than the other classes
System ideas:
* Bridge
  *
  *
* Shield Generator

* Engine Room

* Gun room

* Medical bay
